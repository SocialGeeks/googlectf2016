Subcategory: Exploitation

Have you ever written a Power-full exploit before? Here's your chance to do
that with a PowerPC remote code execution vulnerability!

The binary is running on ssl-added-and-removed-here.ctfcompetition.com on port
10000. Don't forget to account for SSL offloading when developing your exploit.

This binary may taste similar to Pumpkin Cake.. ;)
